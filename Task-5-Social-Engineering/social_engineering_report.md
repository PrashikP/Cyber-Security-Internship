# Research Report: Social Engineering Attacks

## 📌 Objective
To understand the different types of social engineering attacks, their impact on organizations, and strategies to prevent them.

---

## 🎭 Attack Type 1: Phishing
- **How it works:** Attackers send emails or messages pretending to be from trusted sources (banks, HR, IT support). Victims are tricked into clicking malicious links or sharing credentials.  
- **Impact:** Credential theft, financial fraud, malware infections.  
- **Real-world example:** The 2016 U.S. election phishing campaign against political figures.  
- **Prevention:** Employee training, strong email filtering, multi-factor authentication.

## 🎭 Attack Type 2: Pretexting
- **How it works:** An attacker builds a fake story (the “pretext”) to gain trust. Example: pretending to be a colleague or IT admin to request sensitive info.  
- **Impact:** Leaks of private data, unauthorized access to internal systems.  
- **Real-world example:** Attackers posing as IT staff to trick employees into sharing login details.  
- **Prevention:** Strict verification of identity before sharing information, awareness programs.

## 🎭 Attack Type 3: Baiting
- **How it works:** Victims are lured with something attractive (free USB drives, free downloads) that secretly carry malware.  
- **Impact:** Malware infection, data theft, compromised systems.  
- **Real-world example:** USB sticks infected with malware left in company parking lots, waiting for curious employees.  
- **Prevention:** Disable autorun on devices, employee training, strong endpoint protection.

## 🎭 Other Variants
- **Tailgating (Piggybacking):** Gaining physical access by following someone into a secure building.  
- **Quid Pro Quo:** Offering something in return for sensitive information (e.g., “free tech support” scams).

## 🔍 Conclusion
Social engineering is less about hacking machines and more about hacking people. Awareness, training, and strict verification processes are the strongest defenses against these human-centered attacks.
